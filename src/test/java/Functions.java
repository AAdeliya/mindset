        //
        //static means this method belongs to the class Main and not to a specific instance of Main. Which means we can call the method from a different class like that Main.foo().
        //void means this method doesn't return a value. Methods can return a single value in Java and it has to be defined in the method declaration. However, you can use return by itself to exit the method.
        //This method doesn't get any arguments, but of course Java methods can get arguments as we'll see further on.
